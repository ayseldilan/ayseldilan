### <a name="Inspiration">Inspiration</a>

I have always continued to strive for hard work and dedication on any path set for myself. I am constantly curious in learning, and determined to continue learning new information. Striving for a readable, secure and test driven code. 

### <a name="About">About me</a>

I'm a Full-Stack Developer with 4 years of educational experience. My education was predominantly International Relations focused, culminating a 2:1 International Politics degree from SOAS University, and a year abroad in South Korea studying further political theories. 

It didn't take long for me to start developing theoretical solutions for my thesis and essays. In my thesis, I focused on Middle Eastern Studies and War in Syria. 

I always loved finding solutions to theoretical problems, and now it's time for me to find solutions in tech. Makers Academy were a path way for me to find my passion and unleash into the programming world. Now, I'm excited to put on display the results of my journey so far, and demonstrate my ever increasing tech stack through this portfolio of projects.
